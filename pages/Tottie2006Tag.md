- abstract
	- This large-scale corpus study charts differences between **British English** and **American English** as regards the use of **“canonical” tag questions** such as *It’s raining, isn’t it?*, *It’s not raining, is it?*, or *It’s raining, is it?* Several thousand instances of question tags were extracted from the **British National Corpus** and the Longman Spoken American Corpus, yielding **nine times as many tag questions in colloquial British English** as in colloquial American English (but also important register differences in British English). **Polarity types** and **operators** in tags also differ in the two varieties. Preliminary results concerning **pragmatic functions** point to a higher use of “facilitating” tags involving interlocutors in conversation in American English. **Speaker age** is important in both varieties, with older speakers using more canonical tag questions than younger speakers.
