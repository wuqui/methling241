- [[practice]]: evaluating and improving [[research questions]]
	- Characterise the features, upsides, and downsides of the following research questions and think of ways to improve them.
		- How does age influence the accommodation process?
		  collapsed:: true
			- narrow down age range
			- age vs generation
			- which time? → present-day
			- which place/society?
			- “influence” → positive vs negative?
			- “How …”? → more specific, in which ways?
			- “accommodation” → specify which aspects
		- Age and gender influence language use.
		  collapsed:: true
			- not a question!
			- “language use” → too broad
			- “influence”
			- age & gender? really? pick one
		- How do teenagers differ from adults in their use of swear words?
		  collapsed:: true
			- adults: narrow down group to age range
			- “how”
			- “use”: which usage contexts (e.g. text types, register etc.)? frequency?
			- definition of swear words
			- time?
			- place?
		- The older the teenagers are the less they use swear words.
		- To what extent do teenagers accommodate to their peers?
		- Do teenagers accommodate to their peers?
		- Age can influence language use or not.
		- Why do teenagers make use of swear words?
