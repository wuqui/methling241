- # What is corpus linguistics about?
	- Corpus linguistics is a research methodology within the field of linguistics that focuses on the systematic study of language using large and diverse **collections of authentic texts**, known as [[corpora]].
	- These collections of language data, either written or spoken, provide a comprehensive and [empirical basis]([[empirical data]]) for the analysis of
		- language use (e.g. collocational patterns such as _pretty woman_)
		- [[linguistic variation]] across different text types or communities (e.g. neologisms such as _smash_)
		- [[language change]] (e.g. _going to_ future)
	- The primary goal of corpus linguistics is to investigate linguistic phenomena and patterns by examining [real-world language usage]([[empirical data]]).
	- This approach contrasts with more traditional linguistic methods that rely heavily on introspection and theoretical speculation (e.g. Chomsky).

- # What is corpus linguistics good for?
  collapsed:: true
	- Corpus linguistics as a [[usage-based approach]] to linguistic analysis
	  collapsed:: true
		- Corpus linguistics is highly valuable from a usage-based approach to linguistics, as it emphasizes the importance of **actual language use** in shaping linguistic knowledge and structure.
		- The usage-based perspective posits that **linguistic structure and knowledge emerge from the patterns** and regularities that speakers encounter in their experience with language.
		- In this context, corpus linguistics provides a powerful toolset for investigating these patterns and regularities, offering several advantages:
			- **Authentic language data**: Corpus linguistics relies on large and diverse collections of authentic texts, which represent real-world language use. This ensures that the patterns and structures uncovered through corpus analysis are grounded in genuine linguistic behavior, rather than relying on idealized or artificial examples.
			- [[quantitative approach]]: Corpus linguistics allows for the quantitative analysis of linguistic phenomena, such as  [frequency counts]([[frequency]]) and [statistical measures]([[statistics]]). This enables researchers to identify and describe patterns and regularities that emerge from language use, supporting the usage-based claim that linguistic structure is shaped by frequency and distributional patterns in the input.
			- [Collocations]([[collocations]]) and [[constructions]]: The usage-based approach posits that language is composed of form-meaning pairings, known as constructions, which range from morphemes and words to idiomatic expressions and complex syntactic structures. Corpus linguistics offers tools for identifying and analyzing collocations and constructions in large datasets, contributing to our understanding of the relationships between form, meaning, and use.

			- [Variability]([[linguistic variation]]) and context sensitivity: Corpus linguistics enables the examination of language use across different contexts, genres, and [registers]([[register]]). This allows researchers to investigate how linguistic features and structures vary and adapt to different situations, providing insights into the dynamic nature of language and its sensitivity to context, which is a key aspect of the usage-based approach.
			- [Language change]([[language change]]) and development: Corpus linguistics can be applied to [diachronic]([[diachronic]]) and [synchronic]([[synchronic]]) data, allowing researchers to track language change over time and compare different stages of language development. This helps to shed light on the emergence and evolution of linguistic structures, which is of particular interest to [usage-based theorists]([[usage-based approach]]) who seek to explain language change as a result of cumulative changes in usage patterns.
			- Data-driven [language teaching]([[language teaching]]) and [learning]([[language learning]]): The usage-based approach emphasizes the importance of [[exposure]] to authentic [[language input]] in the acquisition process. Corpus linguistics can inform the development of language teaching materials and methods, by providing insights into the most [frequent]([[frequency]]) and relevant structures, vocabulary, and collocations that learners need to acquire.
- # Key concepts
  id:: 643e61f8-cf0b-4b40-b162-8132663181d8
	- [[corpus]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- A corpus is a large, structured collection of texts that serves as the basis for linguistic analysis. Corpora can be general, representing a wide variety of language use, or specialized, focusing on specific genres, registers, or domains.
		  collapsed:: true
	- [[annotation]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- Annotation refers to the process of adding metadata or linguistic information to a corpus, such as part-of-speech tags, syntactic structure, or semantic roles. This additional information can facilitate more in-depth and accurate analyses.
		- [[metadata]]: data **about** language use on several levels:
			- corpus
				- texts: [[author]], [[text type]], [[register]], [[topic]]
					- [running words (tokens)]([[tokens]]): [[word class]], [[lemmatization]]
	- [[concordance]]
	  id:: 648033b8-e219-444d-83dd-04c79b44530c
		- A concordance is a tool that allows researchers to search for specific words, phrases, or patterns in a corpus and display the results in context. This helps researchers to examine language patterns and identify trends across various texts.
	- [[collocations]]
	  id:: 648033b8-7985-4fca-b09e-e5f18cfe1862
		- Collocation refers to the co-occurrence of words within a specific context or proximity. Studying collocations can reveal important information about word usage, meaning, and associations.
		  id:: 643e7a15-ed51-442c-876c-b0e501e8a7c1
	- [[frequency]]
		- Frequency analysis involves counting the occurrences of linguistic features, such as words or structures, within a corpus. This helps researchers identify patterns and trends, as well as compare language use across different corpora.
	- [[n-grams]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- N-grams are sequences of n contiguous words or linguistic units within a text. They can be used to study word combinations, patterns, and structures in a corpus.
			- Example: *The cat sat on the mat.*
			- Example corpus: [[Google N-grams]]
	- [[register]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- Register refers to the language variety used in specific contexts or situations, characterized by particular linguistic features, such as vocabulary, grammar, and style. Examining registers can help researchers understand language variation and adaptation.
		  collapsed:: true
			- a type of [[text type/variation]]
