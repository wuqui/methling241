		- principles of building corpora ([[Knight2022Building]])
		  collapsed:: true
			- The contents of a corpus should be selected without regard to the language they contain, but according to their **communicative function** in the community in which they arise.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Corpus builders should strive to make their corpus as **representative** as possible of the language from which it is chosen.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Only those components of corpora which have been designed to be **independently contrastive** should be contrasted.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Criteria for determining the structure of a corpus should be small in number, clearly separate from each other and efficient as a group in **delineating a corpus** that is representative of the language or variety under examination.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Any information about a text other than the alphanumeric string of its words and punctuation should be stored separately from the **plain text** and merged when required in applications.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Samples of language for a corpus should, wherever possible, consist of **entire documents** or transcriptions of complete speech events, or should get as close to this target as possible. This means that samples will differ substantially in size.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- The design and composition of a corpus should be **documented** fully with information about the contents and arguments in justification of the decisions taken.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- The corpus builder should retain as target notions **representativeness and balance**. While these are not precisely definable and attainable goals, they must be used to guide the design of a corpus and the selection of its components.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Any control of subject matter in a corpus should be imposed by the use of **external**, not internal, **criteria**.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- A corpus should aim for **homogeneity** in its components while maintaining adequate **coverage**, and rogue texts should be avoided.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- creating specialised corpora ([[Koester2022Building]])
		  collapsed:: true
			- **Specific purpose** for compilation, e.g. to investigate a particular grammatical or lexical item;
			- **Contextualisation**: particular setting, participants and communicative purpose;
			- **Genre**, e.g. promotional (grant proposals, sales letters);
			- Type of **text/discourse**, e.g. biology textbooks, casual conversation;
			- **Subject matter/topic**, e.g. economics;
			- **Variety** of English, e.g. Learner English.

						- "The Facts Concerning the Recent Carnival of Crime in Connecticut" (1876)
						  collapsed:: true
							- "The Facts Concerning the Recent Carnival of Crime in Connecticut" is a short story by Mark Twain. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a detailed summary or the publication year on Wikipedia. However, the story is known for its satirical take on morality. It features the protagonist's encounter with his own conscience, personified as a loathsome creature. The protagonist realizes that by listening to his conscience, he has been led to live a life of excessive guilt and moral restriction. In a twist of events, he manages to eliminate his conscience, leading to a series of immoral acts that he carries out with impunity.
