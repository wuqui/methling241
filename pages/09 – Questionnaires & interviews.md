	  collapsed:: true
		- microlinguistic studies vs. macrolinguistic studies
		  collapsed:: true
			- **Microlinguistics**, focuses on the small-scale or micro aspects of language.
			  collapsed:: true
				- This branch of linguistics is concerned with the **details of language structure** and use at the level of sounds (phonetics and phonology), words (morphology), sentences (syntax), and meaning (semantics). Microlinguistics also includes the study of pragmatics, which examines how context influences the interpretation of meaning.
				- The primary focus of microlinguistics is on the **individual speaker** and the **intricacies** of the language itself.
			- **Macrolinguistics**, on the other hand, is a term used to refer to the study of language in a broader or macro context.
			  collapsed:: true
				- This branch of linguistics looks at language in relation to other **sociocultural phenomena**.
				- It includes fields such as
				  collapsed:: true
					- **sociolinguistics** (how language varies and changes in social groups),
					- **psycholinguistics** (how language is processed in the mind),
					- **neurolinguistics** (how language is processed in the brain),
					- **anthropological linguistics** (how language reflects culture).
				- Macrolinguistics also involves the study of **language policy**, **language planning**, and other language-related issues at the societal or institutional level.
		- cross-sectional vs. longitudinal studies
		- pseudo-longitudinal
		  collapsed:: true
			- i.e. repeated cross-sectional studies: survey a representative sample of the target community in 2023, then another representative sample in 2025, and so on → not following the same individuals

- [[interviews]]
	- preparation
	  collapsed:: true
		- Before conducting the interview, it's important to have a clear understanding of the **research objectives**. This will guide the development of the interview questions.
		- It's also important to familiarize yourself with the interviewee's **background**, if possible, to tailor the questions accordingly.
	- building rapport
	  collapsed:: true
		- At the beginning of the interview, spend some time building **rapport** with the interviewee. This can help them feel more comfortable and open during the interview.
