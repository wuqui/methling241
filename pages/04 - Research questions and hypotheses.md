- background on [[Linguistic Landscapes]]
  collapsed:: true
	- what is linguistic landscaping?
	  collapsed:: true
		- Linguistic landscaping is a subfield of [[sociolinguistics]] that focuses on the analysis of language visibility in public spaces.
		- It investigates how different languages are used, displayed, and represented in signs, advertisements, billboards, street names, and other forms of public communication.
		- Researchers in linguistic landscaping typically explore questions related to the interaction between language and society.

	- study areas and [research questions]([[research questions]])
	  collapsed:: true
		- ==Language distribution and representation==: What languages are present in a given area, and how are they distributed? How are minority languages represented compared to dominant languages?
		- ==Language policy and planning==: How do language policies or regulations affect the linguistic landscape? What role does linguistic landscaping play in language promotion, revitalization, or suppression?
		- ==Linguistic [[power]] dynamics==: How does the linguistic landscape reflect or reinforce power dynamics between different language communities? How do dominant languages and minority languages interact in public spaces?
		- ==Multilingualism and language contact==: How do different languages coexist and interact in the linguistic landscape? How does the presence of multiple languages in public spaces impact language contact, language change, or language attitudes?
		- ==Identity and belonging==: How does the linguistic landscape shape or reflect individual and collective identities? How do people use language to express their cultural, regional, or national identity in public spaces?
		- ==Semiotics and meaning-making==: How are different languages used to convey messages in the linguistic landscape? What semiotic resources (e.g., typography, color, images) are employed to create meaning in public texts?
		- ==Language attitudes and ideologies==: What can the linguistic landscape tell us about societal attitudes and ideologies towards different languages? How do linguistic choices in public spaces reflect or challenge language hierarchies and ideologies?
		- ==Public space and urban planning==: How does the linguistic landscape interact with the physical environment and urban planning? What role does language play in the design, organization, and functioning of public spaces?
		- ==Language and tourism==: How does the linguistic landscape contribute to the branding and promotion of a location as a tourist destination? What role do languages play in shaping the tourist experience and the image of a place?
		- ==Methodological and theoretical advances==: How can linguistic landscaping research methods and analytical frameworks be improved or expanded? What theoretical perspectives can help us better understand the relationship between language and public space?
	- [[data]] sources
	  collapsed:: true
		- ==Photographs==: Researchers take photographs of signs, advertisements, billboards, street names, and other public texts in a specific area. These photographs serve as primary data for the analysis of language distribution, representation, and visibility.
		- ==Field notes==: During fieldwork, researchers may record their observations, impressions, and reflections about the linguistic landscape, including contextual information about the location, surroundings, or sociopolitical factors.
		- ==Maps and geospatial data==: Maps and geospatial data can be used to visualize and analyze the spatial distribution of languages in the linguistic landscape. Researchers may create digital maps, use GIS tools, or employ other geospatial techniques to explore patterns and relationships between language and space.
		- ==Interviews and surveys==: Researchers may conduct interviews or surveys with local residents, business owners, or other stakeholders to gather their perspectives on the linguistic landscape, language use, language attitudes, and the impact of language policies.
		- ==Policy documents and regulations==: Analysis of language policies, planning documents, and regulations can provide insight into the official guidelines and rules that shape the linguistic landscape in a given area.
		- ==Media and online resources==: Researchers may analyze local media, social media, or online resources to better understand public discourse and attitudes towards languages and the linguistic landscape.

			- [[podcasts]]
			- [[social media]]: [[Instagram]], [[Twitter]], [[Reddit]] (subreddit: `r/Munich`, `r/LiverpoolFC`)
		- ==Ethnographic data==: In some cases, researchers may use ethnographic methods to explore the connections between the linguistic landscape and local culture, identity, or community practices.
		- ==Archival materials==: Historical documents, photographs, or maps can be used to investigate the evolution of the linguistic landscape over time and the impact of historical events, demographic changes, or language policies.
	- [[methods]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- ==Content analysis==: This involves the systematic and objective analysis of text, images, or other content present in the linguistic landscape data. Researchers may examine the presence and frequency of languages, the types of signs or texts, and the messages conveyed by these public texts.
		- ==Quantitative analysis==: Researchers may use quantitative methods to analyze the distribution and representation of languages in the linguistic landscape. This could include calculating the proportion of signs in different languages, comparing the visibility of languages, or using statistical methods to explore patterns and relationships between variables.
		- ==Qualitative analysis==: Qualitative methods are used to explore the meaning and interpretation of linguistic landscape data, often focusing on the semiotic resources and strategies used in public texts. This may involve a detailed analysis of typography, color, layout, and images, as well as the context and placement of signs.
		- ==Discourse analysis==: Discourse analysis can be used to examine the ways in which language is used to construct meaning and identity in the linguistic landscape. This may involve analyzing the choice of words, phrases, or expressions and exploring how these choices reflect or reproduce broader societal discourses and ideologies.
		- ==Ethnographic methods==: Ethnographic methods, such as participant observation, interviews, or field notes, can be employed to better understand the connections between the linguistic landscape and local culture, identity, or community practices.
		- ==Geospatial analysis==: Geospatial methods, such as GIS tools, digital mapping, or spatial statistics, can be used to visualize and analyze the spatial distribution of languages in the linguistic landscape, as well as the relationships between language and the physical environment.
		- ==Comparative analysis==: Researchers may compare linguistic landscapes across different locations, time periods, or sociopolitical contexts to identify patterns, similarities, and differences in language use and representation.
		- ==Mixed-methods approach==: Many researchers in the field of linguistic landscaping adopt a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative and qualitative methods to provide a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the linguistic landscape.

  collapsed:: true
	- Characterise the features, upsides, and downsides of the following research questions and think of ways to improve them.

		  collapsed:: true
			- narrow down age range
			- age vs generation
			- which time? → present-day
			- which place/society?
			- “influence” → positive vs negative?
