- [[writing]]
	- start early
	  collapsed:: true
		- *Phase I*: before you even start, write a proposal/abstract/summary of your ideas, main hypotheses, your research diary
		- *Phase II*: write while you read
		- *Phase III*: start writing proper with an easy chapter, then go on to the more difficult ones
		- *Phase IV*: revise completed chapters - always check your chapters against your table of contents and if necessary rearrange
		- *Phase V*: write Introduction and Conclusion (also other technical parts like appendix, bibliography etc.)
		- *Phase VI*: revise the complete text - check for coherence ('roter Faden’) once again
		- *Phase VII*: have your text proof-read by a friend and/or a native speaker
		- *Phase VIII*: work in corrections and comments and make a final draft, print it and proof-read it a last time
