  collapsed:: true
	- start with **general introductions** giving you the broader picture
	- **narrow down** your reading to more specific articles, focussing on individual theoretical concepts
	- with each reading refine your **keyword list** to gradually cover the whole research area
	- if you're unsure about the relevance of a text, **skim**: read the abstract, table of contents or index and check for notions that seem to relate to your topic
	  collapsed:: true
		- abstract
		- figures
		- tables
		- conclusion
		- introduction
	- make sure to include the **latest publications** on your topic

- reading and [[writing]]
  collapsed:: true
	- Reading with a specific topic in mind is always tightly linked to writing. For core texts it is advisable to produce an **excerpt**, so that you do not only rewrite the original text, but process the information contained in the literature, formulate it **in your own words** and adjust it to your topic.
	- First reading
	  collapsed:: true
		- get a **general picture** and an outline of the text;
		- note down the **structure** (headings, chapters, sections, paragraphs) on a piece of paper (index cards or first page of a computer file)
		- indicate **irrelevant parts** of the text
	- Second reading
	  collapsed:: true
		- **topic** of each chapter, section, paragraph
		- **summary** of each chapter, section, paragraph
		- names of important **authors/sources**, e.g. for further reading
		- note down possible **quotations** (indicate pages and page break in the quotation)
		- note down helpful **examples**, **tables**, and **figures**
		- summarize aspects that are relevant to your own work, mark potential links to your **research questions** or to chapters in your table of contents
		- make notes to yourself indicating **questions**, unclear explanations, links to other texts you've read
- highlighting and marking
  id:: 64762078-9f92-47fb-a7b1-83b8010693eb
  collapsed:: true
	- you can directly work with a photocopy or a **PDF** of the text and highlight and mark all necessary information and thus prepare a commented version.
	- you can use a system of **colours** to work out the structure of the text
	- **highlight** names of authors and researchers, definitions, examples and possible quotations in different ways
	- comment on the **margins** with keywords, paraphrases, summaries, etc.
	- **cross out** passages that are not important for your work
	- additionally, use **post-its**, for notes to yourself indicating cross-references to other texts, own ideas, and problematic passages
	- all of this works really well when using **[[Zotero]]'s PDF reader**
