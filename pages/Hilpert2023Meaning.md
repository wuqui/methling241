	- > This paper uses corpus data and methods of [[distributional semantics]] in order to study English [clippings]([[clipping]]) such as dorm (< dormitory), memo (< memorandum), or quake (< earthquake).
	- > We investigate whether systematic [meaning differences]([[semantic/variation]]) between clippings and their source words can be detected.
	  id:: 9a4c1338-4831-45bd-bf44-d32122aef794
	- > The analysis is based on a sample of 50 English clippings.
	- > Each of the clippings is represented by a [concordance]([[concordance]]) of 100 examples in context that were gathered from the [Corpus of Contemporary American English]([[COCA]]).
	  id:: 98a1e035-a4b1-4125-90bd-3c03ffefb06a
	- > We compare clippings and their source words both at the aggregate level and in terms of comparisons between individual clippings and their source words.
	  id:: 7d66160c-7486-4a68-a6f2-68bf45afefca
	- > The data show that clippings tend to be used [in contexts]([[text type/variation]]) that represent involved text production, which aligns with the idea that clipped words signal familiarity with their referents.
	  id:: aff71db3-d8af-47cb-945a-52eed1dfe8f2
	- > It is further observed that individual clippings and their source words partly diverge in their distributional profiles, reflecting both overlap and differences with regard to their meanings.

	- > We interpret these findings against the theoretical background of [Construction Grammar]([[Construction Grammar]]) and specifically the Principle of No Synonymy.
