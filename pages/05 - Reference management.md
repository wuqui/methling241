		- general recommendation:
			- use a tool for ((6451ff83-844b-4d58-8d7f-95ce3bd20491)) (e.g. [[logseq]]) so that you can link notes and thoughts to important concepts (see [[note-taking]])
		- sustainable note-taking
			- store citation information alongside notes you're taking (e.g. Schmid 2016: 58)
			- mark everything you copy verbatim to avoid plagiarism
